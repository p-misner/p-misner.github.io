        <h3> Background </h3>
        <p> In this project, we attempted to create something that would harvest hydroponic gardens. Looking at the future, we believe that hydroponic gardens may become necessary to feed the growing population. Most systems are made of small cups placed in rows or pipes that contain water or a water-nutrient mixture. These gardens can grow most types of food, like berries, lettuce and other leafy greens, or herbs. They require little in terms of soil and land, and can be grown vertically. However, the downside is that these vertical gardens cannot be grown higher than the gardener can reach, or how far they can reach on a ladder. Our challenge was to build something that could harvest the small cups and bring them to the gardener, enabling the gardener to plant gardens much taller than they could reach on their own. </p>

       <h3> Components</h3>
       <p>The project was broken up into two main components, the XY plotter and the harvester. </p>
       <h4>XY Plotter</h4>
       <h4>Harvester</h4>
       <p>The harvester was made of two different motors, one that controlled rotation and one that controlled the movement of the harvesting arms. The arms were designed to scoop the pots using hooks; these hooks would attach to the loops added to the traditional cups in the hydroponic system. </p>
       <p>The harvester is controlled by a Raspberry Pi that can be accessed using Wifi. This controlled “speaks” to an arduino over serial communications; which controls the positions of the two stepper motors. When controlling the harvester, commands dictate turning the bot to position the arms in alignment with a pot, and moving them up and down. Currently, each command to turn does not turn the bot very far to allow for fine-tuning of the machine.</p>
       
       <div class='six column modelo-wrapper'>  
               <iframe src="https://app.modelo.io/embedded/TwqR-K9LI_?viewport=false&autoplay=false" style="width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen allowfullscreen ></iframe> 
       </div>
       
       <p>The motor that controlled the rotation was also the connection point between the bot and the XY plotter. A motor sleeve was made to clamp over the D shaped motor shaft, and was designed to have a small lip, allowing for the ropes to be fixed to this point. The weight of the bot allowed for it to be turned without twisting the ropes. The arms are threaded within small shafts that allow for rotation.</p>
       <p> A pulley attached to the shaft of one of the motors allows for the bot to wind the ropes connecting the arms up and therefore raise the arms (the reverse lowers them). There were some problems getting this to function properly, spooling the rope proved challenging, as the off-center placement of the spool meant that the arms came in at an angle. This was solved by adding some rudimentary pulleys to the bot to allow for better alignment. </p>
     
       <h4> Misc Other Challenges</h4>
       <ul>The motor that controlled the rotation was also the connection point between the bot and the XY plotter. A motor sleeve was made to clamp over the D shaped motor shaft, and was designed to have a small lip, allowing for the ropes to be fixed to this point. The weight of the bot allowed for it to be turned without twisting the ropes. The arms are threaded within small shafts that allow for rotation.

       <h3> Next Steps/ Future Improvement</h3>
       <p> In the future, improving the accuracy of the replacement of the harvester would be a huge step towards making this a marketable item. Without replacement, it makes it difficult for this to be a fully useable object. Currently, replacement is tricky and is not easily replicable. </p>
