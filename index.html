        <h3> Background </h3>
        <p> In this project, we attempted to create something that would harvest hydroponic gardens. Looking at the future, we believe that hydroponic gardens may become necessary to feed the growing population. Most systems are made of small cups placed in rows or pipes that contain water or a water-nutrient mixture. These gardens can grow most types of food, like berries, lettuce and other leafy greens, or herbs. They require little in terms of soil and land, and can be grown vertically. However, the downside is that these vertical gardens cannot be grown higher than the gardener can reach, or how far they can reach on a ladder. Our challenge was to build something that could harvest the small cups and bring them to the gardener, enabling the gardener to plant gardens much taller than they could reach on their own. </p>
