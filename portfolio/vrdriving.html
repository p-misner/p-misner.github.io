		<h1> Virtual Reality Driving Simulator </h1>
		<h2>a customizable high fidelity virtual reality driving simulator built in Unity</h2>
		<h3> Overview</h3>
		<p> Advances in virtual reality now make the creation of life-like virtual, customizable environments much lower cost and accessible than ever before. Current driving simulators often consisit of a quarter-cab of a vehicle surrounded by television screens to simulate the driving experience. These set up costs tens of thousands of dollars and take up entire rooms. In this project, I lead a team of four other students to develop a realistic driving experience via a virtual reality headset for a cheaper, smaller alternative to a full-scale simulator.  </p>
		<h3> Background and Motivation </h3>
		<div class="imggroup">

		</div>
		<p class="caption"> Priya and Julie brainstorming possible features for the simulator</p>

		<p> Prior to beginning this project, I spent a summer working at the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, MA. While developing a driving simulations for the Federal Railway Adminstration, I was exposed to the interface of the popular SimCreator software from Realtime Technologies. This software let the user build a world by dragging and dropping objects from a folder but getting objects to move (ie. lights to change, pedestrians to walk) required coding knowledge. The graphics in this software were far behind that of modern video games. Further, the size of simulator meant that it couldn't be moved and research study particpants had to come to the simualtor which made recruiting certain participant populations more difficult. </p>

		<p> My prior experience attempting to use the Oculus Rift to simulate a driving experience (check out the <a href="./pedcrossing.html">Pedestrian Crossing Simulator</a>) got me thinking, was it possible to use a VR headset and open-source resources like Microsoft AirSim to make a cheap, portable, customizeable driving simultor? </p>

		</div>
		<p class="caption"> A screengrab of a street corner created with components from Microsoft Airsim </p>
		<p>The suburban road environment was created using Microsoft AirSim and the Unity game engine. For the vehicle, we downloaded a five passenger sedan from the Unity Asset Store and added an interactive infotainment screen to the dashboard of the vehicle. While initially we planned on integrating a GT Force Gaming Wheel into the simulation, a virtual driving wheel that the was controlled via the Oculus Hand Controllers was more intuitve for the user to interact with. </p>
		<h3> Current Features</h3>
		<div class="vrlist"> <h5> Autonomous Driving</h5>
			<ul> 
				<li> Path planning for autonomous vehicle, trigger blocks to stop and start car, vehicles on the road, in-vehicle infotainment screen Sickness </li>
				
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="vrlist"> <h5> Environment </h5>
			<ul> 
				<li> Based environment on the  Windridge City from Microsoft AirSim. Weather like fog can be triggered. Pedestrians walking paths can be controlled </li>
				
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="vrlist"> <h5> Simulator Sickness</h5>
			<ul> 
				<li> Integrated VR tunneling feature which is an acceleration dependent  color gradient over the scene to reduce sim sickness</li>
				
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="vrlist"> <h5> Distraction Tasks</h5>
			<ul> 
				<li> User can upload their own image or audio files to create distractions that begin on a trigger</li>
				
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="vrlist"> <h5> Virtual Presence + Interactivity</h5>
			<ul> 
				<li> Virtual hands within the VR world allow the user to interact with objects in the virtual and provide haptic feedback.</li>
				
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="vrlist"> <h5> Data Collection</h5>
			<ul> 
				<li> Data from the simulation recorded to a text file. Speech to Text, keyword recognition, head-tracking and timestamping for object interaction</li>
				
			</ul>

		<h3>Drag and Drop Interface</h3>
		<p> Let's say a user has installed all the the necessary dependencies the DrivingSim needs to operate and now wants their vehicle to stop at a crosswalk briefly before continuing to drive on. How can they make this happen? </p>
		<h6>Step 1</h6>
		<h4 class="step"> Trigger Placement </h4>
			<div class="imggroup">
				<img src="../images/airsim/pause.png"><img>
			</div>
			<p class="caption">A red cube, or 'trigger', is placed before a crosswalk </p>
			<p>For every action, the initial step is to place a 'trigger' or colored cube at the location where the user wants the action to occur. Creating a cube is a basic operation in the unity interface- it can be done by selecting the 'Cube' option from 'GameObject' dropdown in the banner or by controll clicking in the Hierarchy menu and selecting 'Cube' from the dropdown. Since the car needs to stop before the crosswalk, a red cube is created and placed in front of a crosswalk. </p>
		
		<h6>Step 2</h6>
		<h4 class="step"> Connecting Script File </h4>
		<div class="imggroup">
			<img src="../images/airsim/dragscript.png"><img>
		</div>
			<p class="caption">Dragging the Pause.cs script onto the trigger cube </p>
		<p> From the Project panel at the bottom of the Unity Graphical Interface, the user will open the 'Scripts' folder from the 'Assets dropdown.' A collection of prewritten code files are inside this folder with descriptive names. A more detailed description of what each script can be do is recorded in the provided hosted in the github where the files were originally downloaded from. For this description, the user will select the 'Pause.cs' script. They can then drag the script icon onto the Red trigger cube to attach it to that object</p>

		<h6>Step 3</h6>
		<h4 class="step"> Modifying Variable Values </h4>
		<div class="imggroup">
			<img src="../images/airsim/variable.png"><img>
		</div>
		<p class="caption">From the inspector panel, values relating to pausing the car can be modified. </p>
		<p>Once the script has been placed on the trigger, the user will click on the trigger and, in the inspector panel, can see the values that can be modified. In the case of the 'Pause.cs' script, the amount of time the car waits and the speed of the car after the wait time is finished can be changed. So, all the user needs to do to get the car to briefly wait at the crosswalk is increase the Pause Time to something like 5 seconds. And voila, without writing a single line of code the user can modify and customize their driving simulation.   </p>

		<h3> Ongoing Development </h3>
		<p> Covid-19 and the subsequent closure of Tufts University has stalled progress on the development of DrivingSim. When it is safe to resume, DrivingSim will be used in an IRB-approved study investigating the effect of augmented reality cues on driver vigilance in autonomous vehicles.  </p>
		<div class="spacer"></div>


		<!-- <h3> Sim Sickness Reduction</h3>
		<p>Sim sickness is caused by the misiscommunication between the eye and inner ear and can cause people to feel nauseous and light-headed when experiencing VR. For the driving simulation, without modification, nausea would arise in the first few minutes of putting on the headset. To combat this feeing, we obscured the particpant's peripheral vision by integrating VR Tunneling and using the car interior to provide a fixed point of reference.
