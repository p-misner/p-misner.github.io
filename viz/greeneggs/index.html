      <h1> Green Eggs and Ham </h1>
      <p> The legend goes that Theodor "Dr. Seuss" Geisel's publisher bet him $100 that he couldn't write a book with less than 50 words. He took his publisher up on the bet and the end result was the children's classic: Green Eggs and Ham. I wanted to explore the patterns and data in the fifty words behind the story of Sam-I-am and his quest to get people to eat both green eggs and ham. </p>
      
      <p>At one appearance, the word 'if' is Green Eggs and Ham's least common word. It is only used in the sentence "If you will let me be, I will try them." The words "I" and "not" tie for most frequently used words at 84 appearances each. The 50 words that appear in the story are as follows:</p>

Sentences structures like: "Would you like them here or there? Would you like them in a house? Would you like them with a mouse?" are common. These three sentences have identical starts and differ in their last three words.

      <p>Eight sentences in the book start with the word 'Would' and all eight of them are followed by the word 'you'. 'Would you?' appears as a complete sentence three times, while the other sentences starting with 'Would' are all exactly seven words in length. Depicting the sentences as a tree diagram, you can see what sentence beginnings are common and what word combinations are unique.  </p>
